The purpose of this project is to create a graphing calculator by using an Arduino Uno/Mini
The calculator will be (obviously) meant to evaluate expressions of numbers (including special functions like trig functions or the special number e etc).
It also will be able to take in expressions with a variable (which will just be x for simplicity) and repeatly evaluate it to get values for the purpose of graphing on a coordinate plane.
The display we are using is the SSD1306 OLED screen (the size for reference is 0.96 inches).
Graphing will be accomplished by drawing lines on the OLED over a sequence of points and also (probably) based on some sort of zoom factor.
Hopefully by the end polynomials (of integer powers), square roots (maybe cube roots too), trig functions and Exponetial functions are able to be graphed.
